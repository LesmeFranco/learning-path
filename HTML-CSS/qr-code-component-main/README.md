## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (CSS variables)
- Flexbox for layout
- Responsive, mobile-first design
- Deployed on Vercel

### What I learned

This project helped me understand how to break a webpage down into smaller parts and build the layout step by step. I practiced using `div` containers to create layers and structure content, allowing me to scale and position sections of the page more intentionally. By organizing the interface into logical blocks and applying CSS for spacing and alignment, I improved my approach to composing responsive layouts and reasoning about the page's structure.

### Continued development

Well, i'm really keen on learning more about CSS and HTML because i feel there are many parts of code that I don't understand how to write and reason about.

### Useful resources

- [Web Dev HTML](https://web.dev/html) - This helped me to undersantd all the elemnents and html components. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Web Dev CSS](https://web.dev/css) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
