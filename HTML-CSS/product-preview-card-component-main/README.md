## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox layout
- CSS media queries for responsive design
- Google Fonts (Fraunces and Montserrat)
- Box shadow effects
- CSS transitions and hover states
- Mobile-first approach
- Vercel Deployment

### What I learned

This project reinforced my understanding of key responsive design concepts:

- **Flexbox mastery**: Implementing flexible layouts with `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, and `gap` properties for both desktop and mobile views
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Using CSS variables for maintaining consistent color schemes and making the codebase more maintainable
- **Media Query Strategy**: Implementing a mobile-first approach with breakpoints to ensure optimal layouts across different screen sizes
- **Semantic HTML**: Structuring markup with meaningful HTML5 elements for better accessibility and SEO
- **Interactive Elements**: Creating smooth hover and focus states using CSS transitions for improved user experience
- **Typography Integration**: Working with Google Fonts and ensuring proper font hierarchy and readability
