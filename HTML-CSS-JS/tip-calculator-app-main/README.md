## My Process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5** markup
- **CSS Custom Properties** for consistent styling
- **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** for layout
- **Mobile-first Workflow** for responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactivity

### What I Learned

During this project, I learned how to manipulate buttons and inputs with JavaScript to create a responsive calculator. Key takeaways include:

- Handling user input validation and dynamic updates.
- Implementing responsive design using CSS media queries.
- Using event listeners for interactive elements.

### Continued Development

In future iterations, I plan to:

- Add more customization options, such as different themes.
- Implement local storage to save user preferences.
- Enhance accessibility features for better usability.

### Useful Resources

- [Web Dev CSS](https://web.dev/learn/css) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
