## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

With this project, I learned how to work with a mobile-first approach, focusing first on building a solid layout for smaller screens and then adapting it for desktop using media queries. I also learned how to handle user interactions with JavaScript by listening to button events and toggling UI elements, making the component fully responsive and interactive.

### Useful resources

- [Web Dev CSS](https://web.dev/css) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
